        <h3>
            <ul>
                <li>RandomForestClassifier: An ensemble learning method using multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. Ideal for classification tasks.</li>
                <li>GradientBoostingClassifier: Another ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, optimizing errors from previous models. Suitable for complex datasets.</li>
                <li>AdaBoostClassifier: An adaptive boosting method that combines weak classifiers iteratively to form a strong classifier. Effective for reducing bias and variance.</li>
                <li>LinearRegression: A basic model for predicting continuous values by fitting a linear relationship between features and targets.</li>
                <li>LogisticRegression: A statistical model for binary or multi-class classification problems using a sigmoid function for prediction.<li>
                <li>DecisionTreeClassifier: A tree-based model that splits data into branches based on feature conditions for classification.</li>
                <li>SVC (Support Vector Classifier): A model that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate data into classes, effective for high-dimensional spaces.</li>
                <li>KNeighborsClassifier: A simple algorithm that classifies a sample based on the majority class among its 'k' nearestÂ neighbors.</li>
            </ul>
